# Gender Equity Among Faculty at UNC Chapel Hill

## Introduction  
This report explores gender equity among faculty in the UNC College of Arts and Sciences.  
It defines gender equity using an index based on:  
- Tenure track status differences between men and women  
- Wage gaps within departments  
- Distribution of men and women in leadership roles  

Gender equity in academia impacts who studies certain fields and their career outcomes. Creating equitable departments helps students and professors of all backgrounds reach their full potential.

## Methodology  

We created **three metrics** to measure gender equity (higher score = better equity):

1. **Salary Equity**  
   - Median salaries compared by gender within each department  
   - Penalizes departments where women earn less than men by more than 10%  

2. **Tenure Track Equity**  
   - Compared UNC-wide gender splits in tenure ranks (Assistant, Associate, Full Professor) to each department  
   - Scores normalized between -1 and 1  

3. **Leadership Equity**  
   - Scores based on whether department chairs are female and gender makeup of the department  

Metrics were combined using a weighted sum:  
- Salary (20%)  
- Tenure Track (30%)  
- Leadership (30%)

## Results  

- **Salary Equity:** Humanities departments like Anthropology and Music show the least wage gaps. Some social sciences, e.g., Sociology, have large gaps with men earning more.  
- **Tenure Track Equity:** Sociology ranks highest here; STEM fields like Computer Science rank lowest.  
- **Leadership Equity:** Women and Gender Studies ranks highest (only female faculty), while STEM fields have fewer female chairs.  
- **Overall Equity:** English and Comparative Literature ranked most equitable; Mathematics, Linguistics, and Computer Science ranked lowest.

## Discussion  

- Gender disparities impact academic tracks, hiring pools, and academic experience.  
- Women faculty presence encourages more women to pursue those fields, improving diversity and educational quality.  
- Limitations include lack of race data and inability to control for merit-based pay differences.  
- Future research should explore policies to increase faculty diversity or support female students to create more balanced academic fields.
